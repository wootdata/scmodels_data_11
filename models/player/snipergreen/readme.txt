INSALLATION FOR COUNTER-STRIKE

Download the pak explorer and replace any .mdl you would like to replace with Sniper Wolf.
You will then see Sniper Wolf  in the  game instead of the swats/terrorist u replaced. I suggest you
replace the arctic.mdl with sniperwhite.
Hope you enjoy it.


INSTALLATION FOR HLDM

Create a "sniperwhite" or/and  a "snipergreen" folder in this location:  C:\SIERRA\Half-Life\valve\models\player
And extract the sniperwhite.mdl and snipergreen.mdl to their same named folder.
You will not see her picture when you go to select her form the HL options. However once you are in a mutiplayer
game, just type this in the console and you'll be all set:   model snipergreen         or model sniperwhite
Booyaa, ur got yourself a HLDM Sniperwolf now ;)
