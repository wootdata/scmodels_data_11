Quistis V0.3 by Ocelot

You have been the recipient of an Ocelot work, consider yourself fortunate.

____________________________________________
Future updates include:

More work on the belt (It doesn't look all that good on the right hip)
Dress (In FF8, Quisty wears a dress, not slacks. With any luck, i'll be able to fix that.)

And maybe, maybe in a much later version, i'll fix the hair.

Special thanks to Cloud for making the original version that I did this one from. If you're readin' this, Cloud? Clothes and hair were almost perfect man, but you really needed to put more work into the face.. so keep workin' on those Final Fantasy models!
